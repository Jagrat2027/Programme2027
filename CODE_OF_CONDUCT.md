## 🚫 Not allowed

## ✅ If you need help

If something makes you feel unsafe or silenced in this space:

📬 Contact: [jagrat2027@gmail.com](mailto:jagrat2027@gmail.com)  
or open an issue marked `moderation`.

We will listen, not punish. This is not a tribunal. It is a project built on human dignity.
