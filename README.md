# Programme2027 – A Living, Open Source Political Program

**Programme2027** is a living, open source political program for France—a human-centered, evolving manifesto built on real experience, collective intelligence, and ethical ambition.

This project aims to inspire, structure, and open up a new horizon for the nation, by reconnecting politics with reality and participation.  
Everyone is invited to read, challenge, adapt, and enrich the program.

## Why a Living, Open Source Program?

Conventional political platforms are often static, opaque, and disconnected from real life.  
**Programme2027** is the opposite:  
- It evolves with input from citizens, professionals, and public agents  
- It’s transparent and versioned on GitHub  
- It’s not a collection of promises, but a framework for reconstruction—starting from the ground, needs, and concrete experience

> “A just project can be said simply. Truth belongs to everyone.”

## Guiding Principles

- **Clarity**: Every proposal must be understandable by a 10-year-old
- **Reversibility**: No measure is permanent if it breaks human connection
- **Transmission**: Everything built here should be reusable and improvable
- **Real Impact**: Actions are judged by what they change in real life
- **Collective Balance**: No one decides alone; every voice counts
- **Open Contribution**: Every citizen can suggest, correct, or enrich the text
