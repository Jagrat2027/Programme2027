## Why a Living and Open Source Program?

Traditional political platforms are often rigid, opaque, and disconnected from the people.  
**Programme2027** takes the opposite approach:

- It evolves through contributions from citizens, professionals, and public service workers.
- It is transparent, version-controlled on GitHub, and accessible to all.
- It is not a list of promises but a human reconstruction framework, built from real needs and field experience.

> “A just project can be said simply. The truth belongs to everyone.”

## Founding Principles

- **Clarity:** Every proposal should be understandable by a 10-year-old.
- **Reversibility:** No reform is final if it breaks the human bond.
- **Transmission:** Everything created must be reusable and improvable.
- **Real-World Impact:** Actions are judged by what they actually change in people’s lives.
- **Collective Balance:** No one decides alone; every voice matters.
- **Open Contribution:** Any citizen can suggest, correct, or enrich the content.

## 🇫🇷 France & 🌍 International Use

Programme2027 was originally written for France, with a national goal: to present a coherent, citizen-driven alternative by the 2027 presidential election.

However, the project is fully open-source and can be **forked, adapted, or translated** for use in other countries or local contexts.  
We encourage contributors worldwide to:

- Reuse the structure, method, and values
- Translate and adjust chapters to their own civic realities
- Create dedicated adaptation folders (e.g. `/adaptations/Canada`, `/adaptations/Senegal`)
- Build long-term roadmaps beyond any electoral urgency

👉 See [`ROADMAP-FR.md`](./ROADMAP-FR.md) for the French timeline  
👉 See [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) for international, long-term forks
