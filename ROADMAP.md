# ROADMAP – Programme2027 (International Forks)

**Programme2027** is a living, evolving political framework.  
While originally written for France (with a 2027 deadline), this repository is also designed to be adapted and forked for use in other countries, regions, or local communities.

This roadmap outlines the long-term goals, open development areas, and opportunities for contribution **beyond the French context**.

## 🎯 Long-Term Vision (2025–2030)

- Offer a clear, ethical, open-source alternative to political stagnation
- Provide a modular and reusable structure for civic transformation
- Encourage citizen participation and institutional introspection
- Create a library of local adaptations and documented experiments
- Support international forks, translations, and thematic reinterpretations

---

## 🛠 Active Development (2025)

- [x] Core structure published (README, CONTRIBUTING, GOVERNANCE…)
- [x] Founding principles and method defined
- [ ] Conversion of the original French program into modular `.md` chapters
