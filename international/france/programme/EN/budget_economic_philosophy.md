## 1. A Plan for Productive and Social Investment

Programme2027 is not just a list of expenditures or a split of resources. It is grounded in a logic of **investment**, where every euro committed seeks a double return:
- **1/3 direct investment:** funds needed to launch transformations, modernize, innovate, include, and strengthen the country‚Äôs resilience.
- **2/3 indirect reimbursement:** savings generated by reducing non-take-up of rights, lowering social and health risks, productivity gains, decreased conflict, and improved cooperation and collective well-being.

**Each measure is designed to create sustainable value for society as a whole.**

## 2. Absorption Capacity Based on Meaning and Mobilization

The main barrier to public policy is rarely resources, but the difficulty of mobilizing energies and absorbing change.  
Programme2027 is based on the following principles:
- **A renewed common purpose:** giving meaning to public action is the first condition for success.
- **A ripple effect:** when society regains confidence and clarity about its objectives, the capacity for absorption and innovation in the public system increases.
- **A global productivity effect:** improved social climate, cooperation, recognition, and inclusion generate significant ‚Äúlatent‚Äù productivity gains (less conflict, absenteeism, loss of meaning; more cross-functionality, etc.).

## 3. Assumed Resilience in the Face of Crises and Uncertainty

The plan is designed to remain relevant in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty (inflation, financial crisis, international shocks).  
**The TOGAFrance method** is the ‚Äúship‚Äù that keeps the course in all circumstances:
- **Method = steering:** it allows for adjustment, reprioritization, rescheduling, or acceleration according to reality and context.
- **Philosophy = direction:** the plan‚Äôs values and aims serve as a compass to avoid sacrificing the essential to the urgency of the moment.
- **Adaptability:** each action, each block, can be reprioritized, accelerated, postponed ‚Äî but the overall logic endures.

## 4. Transparency, Auditability, Evolvability

- All estimates, assumptions, sources and feedback are public and documented.
- The plan is designed to be audited, amended, and adapted, without ever losing track of the original vision.
- Leverage effects (social, environmental, economic) are regularly re-evaluated and shared.

## 5. A Commitment: Aligning Ambition, Responsibility and Adaptability

Programme2027 holds that transforming a country is neither a heroic act nor just a sum of promises,  
but a **collective, transparent, manageable, adjustable and accountable investment process**.

The trajectory may change ‚Äî the course remains shared.
