# XIV. Internal Security & Civil Resilience

A country does not stand by borders alone —  
but by its ability to protect itself  
through law, humanity, and realism.

This chapter unites three key dimensions:

- Daily protection for citizens  
- Civil resilience in the face of future crises  
- A sovereign, lucid, and future-ready army

## 📜 Key Measures

### 🤝 Revaluing Universal Civic Service  
- Voluntary 9-month missions in areas like safety, culture, forestry, healthcare  
- Civic training, stepping stone to employment or engagement  
- Human support, recognition on CVs, housing assistance  

### 🚓 TOGAFrance Audit – Police, Rescue, Security  
- Ground-level survey across police, gendarmerie, emergency responders  
- Aim: restore meaning, human connection, and real usefulness  
- Co-designed with agents — not against them  

### 📘 National Journal of Order Lessons  
- Every major public event (protests, crises, violence) undergoes transparent analysis  
- Decisions, mistakes, and successful responses documented  
- Goal: institutional memory, error prevention, ongoing learning  

### 📰 Regaining Control over "News Incidents"  
- Emergency mediator networks and local response teams  
- Listening centers after each local tragedy  
- Anonymous reports for each serious event  
- Ethical code for media treatment of dramatic news  
> The "incident" must no longer shape the public mindset  

### 🧭 Popular Resilience & Autonomy  
- Biannual local workshops:  
  first aid, energy autonomy, local solidarity  
- Creation of a **government “gentle survival” channel**  
- Right to calm, dignified information and preparation  
> Fear must not precede action — it must be transcended.

### 🛡 Sovereign Army & Protected Technologies  
- Full strategic audit of the French Armed Forces  
- Declare all French military technologies as **non-sellable strategic assets**  
- No resale without public debate and national consent  
- International cooperation is welcome — dependence is not

## 🧠 Philosophical Anchor

**Sun Tzu**  
> “The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.”

> A nation's true strength lies not in what it imposes —  
> but in what it protects,  
> and in how silently it prepares for the unexpected.
