# Preface

This program does not claim to be perfect.  
It is neither a declaration of faith nor a campaign speech.  
It is a starting point. A call. A compass.  
An attempt to shape a different relationship with politics â€” less vertical, less closed, more human.

---

No sentence in this program should be incomprehensible to a ten-year-old.  
Because a just project can be said simply.  
And because what this country needs most is clear truth, not foggy language.

## Three core convictions guide us:

1. It is still possible to **become a people again**, if we speak to each other without shame or dogma.  
2. Politics only makes sense if it returns to what matters most: **a life that is simple, dignified, and shared**.  
3. Not everything is about economics. There are **values that can't be measured**, but they hold a country together.

This text was born of lived experience. Of old anger. Of stubborn trust.  
It does not come from fear or retreat. It comes from a **deep intuition**:  
> If no one puts the pieces back together, the country will collapse.

---

It is not addressed to any side.  
It speaks to all those who, in an increasingly heavy silence,  
can feel that **something is no longer right**.

It is time to **restore meaning. And rebuild connection.**
