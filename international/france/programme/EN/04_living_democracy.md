# IV. Living Democracy

Democracy is not a system â€” it is a practice.  
This chapter seeks to place the citizen back at the center of power.  
Not as a passive spectator, but as a permanent actor.  

A living democracy is not voting every five years â€”  
itâ€™s being able to react, revoke, propose, understand, and oversee.

## ðŸ“œ Key Measures

### ðŸ”„ Midterm revocation of elected officials  
Any public mandate can be interrupted through a citizen-initiated revocation process  
(local or national) if a petition reaches a set threshold.  
The official is publicly heard. If revoked, new elections are held.

### ðŸŽ² Partial sortition in assemblies  
One-third of legislative seats may be assigned to randomly selected citizens â€” trained, accompanied, and non-reelectable.  
A way to break political echo chambers and bring raw voices into the arena.

### ðŸ—£ Assembly of the Unrepresented  
A consultative chamber made up of voluntary citizens from abstaining populations,  
precarious communities, and ignored territories.  
It can issue alerts, counter-proposals, and field reports â€” giving voice to those whoâ€™ve never had one.

### ðŸ§­ Permanent citizen oversight of elected officials  
Each elected official is followed by a local citizen committee.  
Public reporting includes: voting record, attendance, campaign commitments, conflicts of interest.  
Any deviation may be reported nationally and visibly.

### ðŸ’° Mandatory financial transparency  
All management of public funds must be archived, explained, and made accessible.  
Every euro spent on behalf of the people must be traceable.

### ðŸ“° Municipal citizensâ€™ journals  
Each municipality hosts a freely co-funded local media outlet.  
It reports on public decisions, gives voice to minorities, and publishes ground-level realities.

### ðŸš¨ Expanded citizen alert rights  
Any citizen can challenge a national or local project.  
If support reaches a threshold, the project is suspended and a public review commission is convened.

### ðŸŒ± Council for Future Generations  
A consultative body composed of randomly selected youth (ages 15â€“30)  
reviews laws based on their 20-year impact.  
It can issue a public opinion that is legally opposable to texts deemed toxic or short-sighted.

## ðŸ§  Philosophical Anchor

**Cornelius Castoriadis**  
> "There is no democracy unless power is questionable by those who endure it,  
> and the law can be changed by those who obey it."

> Democracy is not declared. It is practiced, verified, and corrected.
