# II. Justice & Transparency

A society cannot stand through fear — only through trust.  
This chapter aims to restore a justice system that is visible, understandable, and accountable.  
A justice that protects without humiliating, that repairs as much as it regulates.  
And that begins by treating the State as a justiciable entity like any other.

## 📜 Key Measures

### ⚖️ Citizen juries at all levels  
In any trial with major public impact (ecology, corruption, institutional violence),  
a randomly drawn citizen jury complements professional judges.  
It has a public recommendation role. Transparency of deliberation is mandatory.

### 📽 Filmed pardon as an alternative to short prison terms  
For minor offenses, the offender may choose to publicly record an act of recognition and reparation.  
If the victim consents, the pardon serves as symbolic closure.  
A human-based way to prevent recidivism.

### 🏘 Community Utility Villages  
Creation of dedicated living spaces for non-violent offenders.  
Social work, repair work, study, and mentorship.  
Framed but open — no digital surveillance.  
A different way to repay society while regaining dignity.

### 🏠 Inviolability of the home (except emergencies)  
Any search outside an urgent or flagrant case must be authorized by an independent judge.  
The home is a sanctuary — not neutral ground.

### 📕 Public record of State convictions  
An annual report documents all judicial convictions against the State or its agents.  
Includes details of misconduct, compensation, and institutional response.  
Trust requires visible truth.

### 🏛 Independent prison oversight commission  
Random inspections, public reports, cross-verified testimonies (staff, inmates, caregivers).  
To bring detention centers out of invisibility and prevent systemic abuse.

### 🤫 Absolute right to silence and rejection of behavioral analysis  
Every person has the right to remain silent — even outside legal proceedings.  
Refusal of emotional tracking, digital profiling, or inferred intent without proof is protected.

### 📘 Rewrite of legal codes in plain civic language  
All major codes (civil, criminal, labor, procedural…) will be reviewed, clarified, and simplified.  
Each will include a “citizen-readable” version validated by mixed panels (judges, citizens, independent legal experts).  
Goal: that everyone knows what they risk, what they can do, and what they are worth.  
There is no justice without clarity.
