# VII. Migration & Dignity

France does not shut itself off.  
It breathes.

This chapter is built on a dual truth:  
a nation can only welcome with dignity if it knows who it is.  
And no one can truly be welcomed if they refuse to take part in what defines this country.

- 50 centers for personalized interviews created nationwide  
- 100% of integration requests answered within 6 months  
- Civic and language training required for all accepted applicants

## 📜 Key Measures

### ⏸ Moratorium on new migration flows  
A temporary suspension of new asylum and residency requests for 2 years.  
This period is used to clarify migration policy and reassess national capacity with fairness and coherence.

### 🧾 Human-centered individual interviews  
Anyone on French territory without a defined legal status  
will be received in a structured, respectful interview.  
The process explores their background, intentions, capabilities, and understanding of France.

### 🤝 “Provisional French” status  
Applicants who accept a pact of commitment (language, legal respect, local participation)  
receive a 5-year provisional status.  
This opens a path to real integration — without encouraging illegality or organized precarity.

### ❌ End of ambiguous legal statuses  
No more administrative limbo: neither deported nor regularized.  
Each case will be treated with clarity, dignity, and transparency  
under a simplified republican process.

### 🛫 Right to supported return  
For those who decline the civic pact, or are involved in serious offenses,  
a return to their country of origin is organized with dignity and logistical aid —  
including reintegration support at the local level.

> Welcoming is neither submission nor exclusion.  
> It is about making space — with courage, structure, and clarity.
