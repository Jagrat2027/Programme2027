# V. Diplomacy & Geopolitics

Peace is not a state — it is a will.  
This chapter gives France a voice that is clear, sovereign, and humane.  
Neither submission nor domination.  
A diplomacy of truth, not of posture.  
A free voice, in the name of the people — not hidden interests.

## 📜 Key Measures

### 🌍 Explanatory diplomacy  
Any major international decision (alliance, intervention, withdrawal)  
must be explained to the public in clear language.  
A public platform shares arguments, counterarguments, and allows for large-scale consultative voting.

### 🕊 Civic Diplomatic Corps  
Creation of a global network of citizens trained in mediation, human rights, and local cultures.  
They do not represent a government, but a people. Their mission: listen, de-escalate, bear witness.

### 🪖 Right to ethical military disobedience  
Every soldier has the right to refuse an order they believe violates human conscience or fundamental rights.  
A “Council of Elders” rules on complex cases.  
The duty to obey does not erase the right to think.

### 🇫🇷 Withdrawal from NATO's integrated military command  
France regains strategic autonomy.  
Logistical, humanitarian, and defensive cooperation continues,  
but no military decision may proceed without a public vote and independent legal review.

### 🤝 Treaty of Systemic Non-Interference  
France formally commits not to finance, organize, or support regime change abroad,  
except in cases of formal appeal by an oppressed population or documented genocide.

### 🧾 Suspension of European treaty clauses incompatible with popular sovereignty  
France will suspend enforcement of any European treaty clauses  
judged to contradict the general interest or renewed constitutional principles.  
A democratic review conference will be held in 2028  
to assess the compatibility of current treaties with the new social contract.  
We are not leaving Europe —  
but we reject any logic that destroys peoples in the name of markets.

> It is to speak truth. To connect without dominating. To listen without disappearing.
