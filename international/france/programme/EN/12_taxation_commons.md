# XII. Taxation & the Commons

Tax should no longer be a dirty word.  
It must once again become a promise.

- A promise that what each person gives — even a little — helps hold the country together  
- A promise that those who benefit most will truly contribute  
- A promise that every euro collected has purpose, destination, and clarity

- Eliminate 100 unjust or useless tax loopholes  
- 1 million households raised into the real middle class through redistribution  
- Digital, natural, and land-based commons inscribed into the Constitution

## 📜 Key Measures

### 📈 Progressive, fluid, and solidarity-based tax scale  
A continuous tax system with no fixed brackets, inspired by Luxembourg:  
**TI = (R × T(R)) × C**  
- **R** = net taxable income  
- **T(R)** = progressive smooth rate (up to 45%)  
- **C** = solidarity coefficient, adjustable in times of crisis or recovery  
> Taxation becomes a dynamic act of fraternity.

### 💶 Universal contributive income  
Merge income tax and social contributions into a **single visible line**  
on every payslip — simple and transparent.

### 🚫 Overall taxation cap  
No household will be taxed more than 60% of its total income.  
Effective tax rates of public officials and enterprise leaders will be made public.

### 🧬 Inheritance reform  
- Cap of €500,000 per heir (excluding primary residence)  
- Surplus redirected to an **intergenerational common fund**  
  unless allocated to a socially useful project validated by citizens

### 🛒 Ethical, tiered, and educational VAT  
- **0%** — essentials (food, healthcare, books, water, local transport, repair)  
- **5–10%** — useful/sober goods (basic clothing, bikes, repairable appliances)  
- **20%** — standard goods (electronics, furniture)  
- **35–45%** — luxury or destructive imports (SUVs, yachts, jets)

**Bonus/Malus Add-ons:**  
- **–2%** for goods manufactured within 500 km  
- **+5%** for non-repairable items (repairability score mandatory)  
- **+3–5%** for heavily advertised products (anti-ad VAT)  
- **Annual citizen vote** to adjust VAT on certain product categories

### 🎯 Targeted tax allocation  
- **1% of luxury VAT** → free cultural arts fund  
- **0.5% from telecoms** → digital sobriety programs

### ⚖️ End to unfair loopholes & mandatory minimum tax  
- Remove tax breaks without transparent justification  
- Minimum tax obligation for incomes above €750,000/year

### 🌍 Real contribution from multinationals  
- Tax based on actual profits  
- Ban on artificial offshoring schemes  
- Required contribution to local commons and services

### 🛠 Commons-focused fiscal policy  
- Tax credits for sustainable jobs, training, and the commons  
  (repair networks, mutual aid, community culture...)

### 🔍 Citizen tracking of every euro  
- Public budget transparency platform (open data)  
- Pedagogical interface understandable from middle school onward

## 🧠 Philosophical Anchors

**Étienne de La Boétie**  
> “Resolve to serve no more, and you are free.”

**Thomas Paine**  
> “It is not charity, but justice, that must guide society.”

> Good taxation is not a burden.  
> It is a pact. A civic contribution.  
> A sign that we are still a people — not just a market.
