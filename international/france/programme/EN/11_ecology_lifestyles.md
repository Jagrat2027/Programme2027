# XI. Ecology & Lifestyles

We won’t save the Earth by declaring it a “priority.”  
We will save it by becoming habitable again.

Ecology is not a political niche.  
It is a matter of survival — but also of desire.  
Can we live better, more slowly, with fewer things and deeper connections?

## 🎯 Goals by 2030

- One repair technician for every 5,000 residents in each local area  
- 500 rewilding zones created and managed by citizens  
- Ecological kilometer tax applied to all non-essential products imported from over 2,000 km away

## 📜 Key Measures

### 💶 “Sustainable Lifestyle” Tax Credit  
Each household receives an annual tax credit for low-impact practices:  
repairs, cycling, insulation, composting, shared tools, etc.  
If the credit exceeds the amount of tax owed, it is refunded as a cashable check.  
> The goal is not to punish.  
> The goal is to make common sense easier.

### 🌲 Guided Rewilding  
- Support for protected areas, sanctuaries, ecological corridors  
- Each region decides what to preserve, slow down, and regenerate  

### 🧘 Desirable Simplicity  
- End of planned obsolescence  
- 10-year mandatory repairability for essential goods  
- Public procurement prioritizes use over ownership  

### 🔧 Public Repair Network  
- Repairability index required on essential goods  
- Spare parts must be available for 10 years  
- A local repair technician network is funded by product manufacturers  

### 🎭 Fighting Cultural Obsolescence  
- Traveling cinemas, street theater, public readings  
- Reopening of spaces for silence, restoration, and non-commercial beauty  
- Education in “less but better”: slowness, attention, quality  

### 🚛 Ecological Kilometer Tax  
An eco-tax applies to non-essential imported goods:  
0.01% of the price per kilometer traveled, capped at 60%.  
- Product made 100 km away → 1%  
- Product from 8,000 km away → 60%  
> Purpose: relocalize, discourage absurd trade routes,  
> and restore ecological geography.

**Pierre Rabhi**  
> “Simplicity is not deprivation.  
> It is the luxury of being content with the essential.”

> We want ecology to no longer be a sacrifice, but a joy.  
> A way to reconnect with life, silence, slowness...  
> and the tenderness of the real.
