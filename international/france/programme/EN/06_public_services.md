# VI. Public Services

A public service is not a structure —  
it is a promise.

This chapter aims to reconnect institutions with their original mission:  
to be there for, and with, the people.  

It proposes a complete, structured, and human-centered transformation,  
through a national initiative called **TOGAFrance**.

## 📜 Key Measures

### 💬 Restoring meaning in public service  
Each public agent is granted dedicated collective time  
to reflect on the meaning of their mission.  
Human connection becomes the compass — not checkboxes.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Joint user-staff committees  
Every public institution (hospital, city hall, social service office…)  
holds monthly meetings between volunteer users and professionals.  
Goal: simplify, improve, and humanize services — together.

### 🔧 TOGAFrance plan: systemic redesign  
All public services are re-evaluated through a national methodology  
focused on vision, flows, resources, and real utility.  
Each service produces a clear, visible charter — reviewed annually.

### 🗣 National audit by users  
An open platform gathers millions of real-life testimonials  
about interactions with public services.  
These guide priorities, funding, and reforms.

### 👥 Recruitment by vocation and experience  
In care, education, and frontline fields,  
anonymous competitive exams are replaced by human-centered evaluation paths,  
involving peers, users, and senior staff.  
> To serve, one must understand who they are serving.

### 🚀 Agents’ right to propose  
Any public agent may propose a local improvement.  
If supported by a joint committee, the initiative is tested at the pilot level.  
The field becomes a lab for transformation.

## 🧠 Philosophical Anchor

**Simone Weil**  
> “Justice is respect for reality.  
> And every act of service is an encounter with the real.”

> A public service is not a window —  
> it is a face. A voice. A responsibility to others.
