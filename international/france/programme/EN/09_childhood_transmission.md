# IX. Childhood & Transmission

Childhood is not a target.  
It is not a market, an electorate, or a variable for adjustment.  
It is sacred space.

What a child receives — or loses — outlines the shape of the world to come.  
If we wish to rebuild a nation, we must first protect those who cannot yet escape.

## 🎯 Goals by 2030

- 100% of primary schools offer a daily space for silent reflection by 2028  
- Every student meets a living artist, philosopher, or witness before age 16  
- One annual “inverted transmission” day in every school nationwide

## 📜 Key Measures

### 🛡 Sanctuary for childhood  
- No advertising in areas dedicated to children under 16  
- No touchscreen devices in primary school; digital tools must be slow, regulated, non-addictive  
- Daily moment of free silence in every school  
- A designated adult mentor, always available and outside the institutional hierarchy  

### 🏫 Redesign the school  
- School becomes a space for awakening, not conditioning  
- Encourage experimental pedagogy (nature-based, open classrooms, debates)  
- Real laws are read and discussed, grading is removed from debates, and children learn the right to be wrong  

### 🪶 Transmit without formatting  
- Regular visits from living witnesses: elders, artisans, poets, healers  
- Every child meets a living artist, philosopher, or writer during schooling  
- Creation of a national transmission fund accessible to all municipalities  
- Once a year, children teach something to adults ("inverted transmission")  

### 🗣 Right to free speech  
- Every student speaks in public at least once during schooling (not graded)  
- Ban on all algorithmic surveillance in schools:  
  no behavioral AI, no facial recognition  

### 🧭 Duty of heritage  
- Each municipality maintains a living memory site (trades, struggles, local stories)  
- Local history and territorial roots are actively taught and celebrated

**Maria Montessori**  
> “The child is not a vessel to be filled, but a source to be allowed to flow.”

**Albert Camus**  
> “To misname things is to add to the world’s misery.”

> It is not the child who must adapt to a damaged world.  
> It is the world that must become worthy of a free child.
