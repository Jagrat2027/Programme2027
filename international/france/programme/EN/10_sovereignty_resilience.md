# X. Sovereignty & Resilience

There is no democracy without sovereignty.  
And no sovereignty without an awakened people.

Sovereignty is not about returning to the past.  
It is the right to say no, to do things differently,  
to decide according to our own measure.

We do not reject others.  
But we will no longer submit to rules that erase us.

## 📜 Key Measures

### ⛔ Immediate moratorium on all new privatizations  
No strategic public good (hospitals, energy, water, transport, data)  
may be sold or transferred without direct consultation of the people.  
A public audit of past privatizations will be launched.

### 🌾 Food sovereignty  
- Massive support for local, organic, resilient agriculture  
- Relocalized strategic reserves  
- Development of short supply chains, collective kitchens, rural cooperatives  

### ⚡ Energy sovereignty  
- National plan for “desirable sobriety”  
- Reduction of structural dependencies  
- Citizen investment in local public energy systems  

### 💶 Inalienable monetary sovereignty  
- Revision of Article 123 of the Lisbon Treaty  
  to allow the Bank of France to directly fund projects of public interest  
- If rejected by the EU: targeted exit from this clause, respecting shared values  
- Constitutional right to physical currency (cash)  
- Rejection of any centralized digital currency imposed without debate or alternative  

### 🖥 Digital sovereignty & call to builders  
- All automated public decisions must be: auditable, explainable, challengeable  
- Constitutional right to a non-digital option (paper, counter, human contact)  
- Sovereign digital ecosystem: open-source software, public cloud, civic operating systems  
- National call to ethical engineers, makers, and developers  
  to help build useful digital commons  

> These tools are not accessories.  
> They will become the silent pillars of a living democracy.

### 📜 Treaty & alliance reform  
- All treaties must be reevaluated using human, ecological, and democratic criteria  
- Europe is an alliance, not a dogma.  
  France will remain at the table — as an equal, not a subordinate.

### 🏡 Priority to local authority  
- Municipalities will gain delegated regulatory powers over practical areas:  
  urban planning, food systems, digital services, housing, sobriety  
> Where life is lived, decisions must be made.
