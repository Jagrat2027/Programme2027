# I. Constitution & State

A people stands upright through what they share — not only through what they own.  
For a State to live, it needs a language, a currency, borders, and a shared foundation.  
If any one of these is stripped away, it becomes a manager without a people — a province without a destiny.

## 📜 Key Measures

### 🏛 A new citizen-led Constitution  
To be drafted by a mixed assembly (random citizens, elected officials, volunteers) and approved via referendum.  
It will be taught from middle school, translated into regional languages, and symbolically reviewed and signed yearly by each municipality.

### 🗳 Youth Referendum at Age 16  
Every five years, youth aged 16 to 25 can submit national ideas.  
Any proposal gathering 1 million endorsements triggers a public consultative vote.

### 💶 End of the banking monopoly on money creation  
Revision of Article 123 of the Lisbon Treaty (or targeted withdrawal), allowing Banque de France to directly fund collective-interest projects.

### 💳 Constitutional rejection of mandatory digital currency  
No authority shall impose a central digital currency as exclusive or prioritized.  
The right to use physical money (cash, coins) is guaranteed.  
Every citizen may buy, sell, and transfer without digital tracing, except by judicial order.

### 🇫🇷 Sovereign People’s Day (Annual)  
Each September 21st, municipalities hold a citizen agora.  
No work, no advertising — a screen-free day to reflect together on the country we want to keep alive.

### 📚 Civic education starting in middle school  
What is a law? A budget? A municipality? A conflict of interest?  
These are taught using real-world laws, role-playing, and structured debate.

### 🤝 Voluntary Civic Oath at Age 18  
Each young person may publicly affirm their commitment to building a just, fraternal country.  
This is not a legal obligation nor a political statement — but a symbolic passage.

### 📖 Mandatory clarity in lawmaking  
Every passed law must be accompanied by a version understandable by a 15-year-old.  
This summary is validated by an independent citizen commission.

## 🧠 Philosophical Anchor

**Jean-Jacques Rousseau**  
> “The English people believe they are free. They are only free during the election of their representatives.”

---

> A nation cannot survive without its language, its currency, and its borders.  
> Language is our memory. Currency is our power to act. Borders are our responsibility.  
> Remove any one of the three, and what remains is an administered territory — not a country.
