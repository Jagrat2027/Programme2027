# VIII. Work & Solidarity

Work must no longer be a punishment —  
nor a boundary between those who matter and those merely counted.

It must return to what it was meant to be:  
a way to act on the world — not merely survive in it.

And solidarity must no longer be a shameful burden.  
It must once again become our collective backbone.

## 📜 Key Measures

### ⚒ Create your own activity in 4 hours — full social protection  
Any citizen may launch an activity (craft, service, solidarity, art, agriculture...)  
in under 4 hours through a universal public access point (online or physical).  
From the moment of declaration, the person receives full social coverage:  
health, retirement, accident, parental leave, disability, unemployment — with no delay or conditions.  
If the activity evolves or stops, rights remain intact.  
Support and a peer platform are systematically offered.

### 🧩 Common Utility Contract (CUC)  
Anyone excluded from formal employment may propose a useful local activity  
(shared gardens, mediation, mutual aid...).  
If validated by a citizen committee, it is paid at minimum wage and recognized as formal employment.

### 🌱 Universal Dignity Leave  
Right to take a 6-month break in one’s lifetime —  
paid at an enhanced minimum income level —  
to rebuild, care for a loved one, or change paths.  
Granted once, no justification required.

### 🎓 Civic Endowment at Age 18  
Upon adulthood, each young person receives €5,000 to €10,000 depending on their social background.  
Unrestricted use, with optional mentoring.  
Supplemented by a 0% honor loan (up to €30,000),  
repayable after year six on a progressive income scale.

### 🤝 Contribution Recovery Income (CRI)  
Anyone involved in non-market, socially useful activity  
(family caregiver, regular volunteer, community artist, dedicated learner...)  
receives a guaranteed base income supported by the State.

### 💸 Income Cap: 100× SMIC  
No individual income (salary, bonus, dividend...) may exceed 100 times the legal minimum monthly wage.  
The SMIC becomes a protected ethical benchmark.

### 📊 Ethical Success Index (ISE)  
Ethically strong companies (redistribution, job stability, eco-social practices)  
receive tax breaks on bonuses —  
as long as executive bonuses do not exceed 30× the lowest salary.

### 🤲 Active Solidarity Tax Credit (CISA)  
Companies benefit from a tax credit for each employee who contributes up to 2 days/year  
to public-interest missions: school mentoring, disaster relief, civic support…  
Expertise returns to the heart of the nation.

> Work empowers when it connects.  
> Solidarity builds what the market cannot redeem.
