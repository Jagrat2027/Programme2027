# 🧮 Budget Assumptions for the 2027 Programme (France)

This document presents the economic and fiscal assumptions used to build the estimated budgets of the **2027 Programme**, including projected **expenditures**, **revenues**, and **redeployments**.

All amounts are expressed in **billions of euros (€)** over the period **2027–2030**, unless stated otherwise.

---

## 🔹 Methodological principles

- **Low range**: conservative estimate, based on a phased and optimized implementation
- **High range**: maximum estimate including all potential direct costs
- **All figures are gross and in constant euros**
- Scope: only new measures or those requiring direct public funding

---

## 🔹 Cost assumptions by pillar

Each policy pillar includes:

- Public employment costs (new hires, wage increases)
- Infrastructure and training costs
- Social benefits or guaranteed income (youth grants, dignity leaves)
- Transition costs (audits, exits from NATO/EU)
- Direct public investments

Details are provided in files `01_...md` to `14_...md`.
