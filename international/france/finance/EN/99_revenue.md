# 🧮 Budget Assumptions of the TOGAFrance 2027 Program

This document presents the economic and fiscal assumptions used to construct the estimated budgets of the **TOGAFrance 2027 program**, including **projected expenditures**, **new revenues**, and **budget reallocations**.

All amounts are expressed in **billions of euros (€)** for the period **2027–2030**, unless otherwise stated.

---

## 🔹 Methodological Principles

- **Low estimate**: cautious estimate, with progressive and optimized implementation  
- **High estimate**: maximum cost including all direct budgetary impacts  
- **All amounts are gross and in constant euros**  
- The budget only covers **new measures or those requiring direct public funding**

## 🔹 Cost Breakdown by Pillar

Each budgeted pillar includes:

- Public employment costs (new hires, targeted salary increases)  
- Infrastructure and training investments  
- Social rights or guaranteed income (youth endowment, dignity leave…)  
- Transition costs (audits, NATO/EU exits, administrative overhauls)  
- Direct public investments (resilience, health, justice, culture…)

Detailed breakdowns are in files `01_...md` to `14_...md`.
