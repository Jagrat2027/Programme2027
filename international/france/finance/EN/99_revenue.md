# 🧮 Budget Assumptions for the TOGAFrance 2027 Programme

This document outlines the economic and fiscal assumptions used to construct the estimated budgets of the **TOGAFrance 2027 Programme**, including projected **expenditures**, **new revenues**, and **budget redeployments**.

All figures are expressed in **billions of euros (€)** over the period **2027–2030**, unless otherwise specified.

## 🔹 Methodological principles

- **Low range**: conservative estimate with phased and optimized implementation  
- **High range**: maximal estimate including full direct public costs  
- **All amounts are gross and constant euros**  
- Scope includes **only new measures or those requiring direct public funding**

---

## 🔹 Cost components by pillar

Each pillar includes:

- Public employment costs (new hires, salary upgrades)  
- Infrastructure and training investments  
- Social benefits or guaranteed income (youth capital, dignity leave…)  
- Transition costs (audits, EU/NATO exit, administrative reform)  
- Direct public investments (resilience, health, justice, culture…)

Detailed breakdowns are available in files `01_...md` to `14_...md`.
