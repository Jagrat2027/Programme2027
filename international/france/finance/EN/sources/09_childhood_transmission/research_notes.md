## üîç Assumptions by Theme

### 1. Slow, awakened, non-digital school
- Goal: deep transformation of 10,000 primary schools

- Phased implementation over 4 years, in cooperation with school districts

### 2. Right to silence and speech
- Safe listening spaces, adult referents, legal recognition of the right to silence  
- Budget covers staff training, schedule flexibility, and pedagogical integration

### 3. Encounters with living artists
- 20,000 live sessions over 4 years (average ‚Ç¨1,000‚Äì1,500 per session)  
- Includes residency costs, logistics, mediation, and impact assessment  
- Strong integration with local cultural hubs and educational partnerships

### 4. Reversed transmission day
- One annual day per school, co-designed with students  
- Low per-unit cost but high symbolic and pedagogical impact  
- Requires national coordination, educational support, and documentation

### 5. Memory site in each municipality
- Around 35,000 towns and villages involved  
- Budgeted for micro-museums, places of remembrance, mobile theatre, exhibitions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Uncertainties and Limits

- Pedagogical data is often qualitative or locally fragmented  
- Participation rates of artists and municipalities vary by region  
- Some measures depend on school district endorsement and administrative capacity  
- The narrative and symbolic impact is not monetized but considered transformative
