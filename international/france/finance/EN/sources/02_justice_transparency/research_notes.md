# Research Notes – Justice & Transparency

## Citizen juries

- Based on the French criminal court model: randomly selected jurors
- Official compensation: approx. €90/day + expenses
- Hypothesis: extended to 1,000 major trials/year (environment, corruption, institutional violence), 10 jurors per trial → ~€10M/year (excluding training and coordination)

## Alternatives to short prison terms (“recorded forgiveness”)

- Based on restorative justice principles: recognition, victim involvement, reparation
- Estimated cost: creation of a public platform + human support (mediation, psychology, legal follow-up) = €500–600M over 4 years

## Communal utility villages

- Reference: Reinforced Educational Centers (CER)
- Estimated cost per village: €30M/3 years (housing, interdisciplinary staff, logistics)
- Goal: 5 pilot sites + 15 additional = upper envelope ~€1.5–2B

## Rewriting legal codes in plain language

- Objective: make civil, criminal, labor and procedural codes accessible
- Hypothesis: ~1 million pages simplified, at €10/page (legal review + citizen validation)
- Estimated cost: €400–800M over 4 years

## Right to silence and protection from behavioral AI

- Hypothesis: technical audits, legal protections, training in public services, awareness campaigns
- Estimated budget: €150–300M

## Independent commission on prisons

- Cost reference: CGLPL (Controller-General for Places of Deprivation of Liberty) = ~€20M/year
- Includes reporting platform + randomized inspections + multi-perspective reports
- 4-year cost: ~€80M

## Public registry of State convictions

- Open-access platform interfaced with administrative and judicial decisions
- Coordination with CADA, Defender of Rights, ECtHR
