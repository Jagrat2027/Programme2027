# üóíÔ∏è Research Notes ‚Äì 10_Security_Resilience

Cost assumptions and technical hypotheses supporting the measures proposed for internal security and civil resilience.

## üìä General Methodology

- Estimates expressed in millions of euros with a 50% margin between low/high scenarios  
- Distribution across 2027‚Äì2030 based on legal and territorial complexity  
- Cost structure: training, coordination, equipment, civic mobilization

## üîç Assumptions by Theme

### 1. Upgraded Universal Civic Service
- 100,000 young volunteers per year with raised stipends and broader mission scope  
- Budget includes mentoring, digital platforms, and local partnerships  
- Duration per volunteer: 9 to 12 months

### 2. Territorial Citizen Guard
- Target: 15,000 trained citizen guards by 2030  
- Inspired by local civil reserves, with added civic and mediation modules  
- Cost = recruitment + training + availability allowance + coordination

### 3. National School of Resilience
- Physical school creation + ongoing decentralized public sector training  
- 2,000 agents trained per year from public, health, and safety sectors  
- Costs include facilities, curricula, publications

### 4. Ethical Watch & Whistleblower Protection
- National and regional reporting units with legal independence  
- Legal aid, confidentiality, social protection, and ethics officer training  
- High strategic value for public institutions and large enterprises

### 5. Municipal Solidarity Safety Plan

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limits and Uncertainties

- Unequal preparedness across territories  
- Social acceptance of new guard or alert mechanisms  
- Fragmented data on local resilience capacity  
- Long-term benefits (cohesion, prevention, autonomy) not monetized
