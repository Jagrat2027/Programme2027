Analytical notes and assumptions used to estimate the cost and ramp-up of each measure, based on French and international data.

## üìä Methodology Overview

- Costs are expressed in millions of euros (‚Ç¨M), with a low/high range per measure  
- Gross estimates include setup, management, social charges, and access equity  
- Operational margins (typically 25‚Äì50%) allow for territorial variability and unknowns  
- Budget allocation spans 2027‚Äì2030 and reflects political feasibility and implementation time

## üîç Notes by Theme

### 1. Fast-Track Activity Creation & Social Protection
- Based on the existing ‚Äúmicro-entrepreneur‚Äù scheme but extended with full social coverage  
- Assumption: 400,000 activations over 4 years (~100,000/year)  
- Cost includes platform creation, advisory network, and automatic social security enrollment  
- Margin includes the fluctuation of declared income and business survivability

### 2. Community Utility Contract (CUC)
- Inspired by civic service, ‚Äúemplois aid√©s‚Äù, and local social economy projects  
- Assumption: ~100,000 CUCs by 2030, co-funded at minimum wage level  
- Budget includes coordination via citizens‚Äô committees and local pilot projects  
- Ramp-up is progressive due to territorial tailoring and validation mechanisms

### 3. Universal Dignity Leave
- Right to a one-time, 6-month income at enhanced RSA level  
- Estimated take-up: ~100,000 people per year  
- Modeled as a hybrid of sabbatical, caregiving leave, and transition support  
- Margin covers substitution costs, outreach, and social monitoring

### 4. Civic Capital at 18
- One-off grant (‚Ç¨5‚Äì10K) and optional honor loan (‚Ç¨0‚Äì30K), repayable from year 6  
- Based on youth access to housing, mobility, and first-time projects  
- Estimated 300,000 recipients by 2030 (universal with social modulation)  
- Margin includes advisory costs, default buffer, and socio-economic gradient

### 5. Contributive Recovery Income (RCR)
- Estimated 200,000 eligible individuals (volunteers, learners, caregivers)  
- Based on minimum revenue threshold to secure informal engagement  
- No requirement of economic return, only social or human contribution  
- Margin reflects validation costs and fraud prevention

### 6. Salary Cap at 100√ó Minimum Wage
- No direct cost, but requires robust tax oversight and legal reform  
- Assumes constitutional amendment or organic law with tracking index  
- Estimated 2-year delay for entry into force  
- Margin is symbolic, calculated only as a monitoring mechanism

### 7. Ethical Success Index (ISE)
- Optional incentive for companies with equity and environmental indicators  
- Assumes adoption by 20,000 firms by 2030  
- Costs appear as fiscal expenditure (exemption ceilings)  
- Margin includes evaluation, dispute handling, and external audits

### 8. Active Solidarity Tax Credit (ASTC)
- Covers up to 2 days/year of paid release for solidarity missions  
- Target: 250,000 missions per year by 2030  
- Based on ‚Äúm√©c√©nat de comp√©tences‚Äù extended to SMEs  
- Margin includes mission certification, employer coordination, and reporting

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Cross-cutting Uncertainties

- Behavior adoption rates are estimated conservatively (e.g., 20‚Äì40% opt-in rates)  
- Some tools (ISE, ASTC) are experimental in French fiscal law  
- Regional disparities may affect cost per user or territory  
- Long-term impact (employment, cohesion, mental health) not monetized here
