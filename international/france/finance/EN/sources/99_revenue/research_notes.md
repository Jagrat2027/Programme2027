# 🗒️ Research Notes – 99_Revenue

Calculation assumptions and benchmarks used to estimate revenues, savings and redeployments.

---

## 💸 1. New revenue streams

- **Cannabis**: benchmarked against Canada (2020–2023), projected 20–25% tax yield on retail turnover  
- **Luxury VAT**: progressive rates with product categorization by social utility  
- **Fluid tax**: effective progressive rate combining income tax and social charges (see Pillar 12)  
- **Anti-fraud**: scaled enforcement, cross-matching via AI, property registries and banking platforms  
- **Expatriates (>€1M/year)**: withholding on French income + global solidarity flat contribution

## 🔁 2. Realistic redeployments

- **Corporate subsidies**: of €140 B/year, ~30% deemed ineffective (Senate report)  
- **EU exit**: net savings from contribution + end of conditional co-funding (~€4 B/year)  
- **NATO exit**: budget relief + redeployment of military forces to domestic defense  
- **Police/Justice reform**: gains via procedure simplification & reduced over-incarceration  
- **Crime costs**: INHESJ estimates crime at ~€115 B/year; 3–5% cut as target  
- **Ultra-high incomes**: marginal tax hike + elimination of specific tax shelters (mobility, options, etc.)
