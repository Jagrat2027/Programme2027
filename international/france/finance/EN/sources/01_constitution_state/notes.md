# Research Notes – Constitution & State

## 🇫🇷 Referendum cost (France, 2005)

- The 2005 referendum on the European Constitution involved 42.3 million registered voters.
- Estimated cost was around €150 million, including logistics, security, and national information campaigns.
- This figure aligns with projections used in this program for future national referenda.

## 📚 Civic education implementation

- National average cost per secondary student (collège & lycée) is ~€8,920/year (2019 data).
- We estimate a deployment cost of €500 per student across 3 years to implement constitutional and civic literacy.
- Sources include the Ministry of Education, OECD education reports, and budget annexes.

## 📆 National “Sovereign People’s Day”

- Municipal budgets for civic commemorations (e.g., May 8, November 11) typically range from €5,000 to €100,000 per event.
- Scaling this for 35,000 French communes results in a rough envelope of €50M–€100M per year.
- The cost includes materials, facilitation, logistics, and loss of revenue for public transport or services.

## 🧾 Plain-language summaries of legislation

## 🧭 Republican oath and digital platform
