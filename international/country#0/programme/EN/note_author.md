# ✍️ Author’s Note

This is not a work of expertise.  
Not a thesis. Not an ideological manifesto.  
It is a reasoned cry. A handmade compass. An attempt to say “no” — but a “no” that opens.

---

I’ve seen too much resignation turn into routine.  
Too much anger collapse into silence.  
Too many young people lowering their eyes, convinced that nothing can change.

This program is not a miracle cure.  
But it draws a clear line —  
the line of a country that no longer wants to betray itself.

---

We have, collectively, a **moral responsibility**  
to never again let the world drift into forgetting its own humanity.

The normalization of contempt, cynicism, social and military violence...  
is **never progress**.

When everything becomes “normal” — war, poverty, humiliation, denial —  
then nothing holds.  
Not law. Not truth. Not even memory.

---

This text was born from one deep conviction:  
**it is still possible to become a people again.**

Not a people *against*.  
A people *for*.  
For dignity. For transmission. For clear-eyed healing.

---

You don’t have to agree.  
You can **doubt**, question, offer better.  
What you’re holding is not a fixed truth.  
It is an **invitation**. A fertile field. A reversible script.

---

We’re not here to add another opinion to the noise.  
We’re here to reopen a path.  
A path of **human reconstruction** — after the noise, after the exhaustion, after the forgetting.

---

To all those who **no longer expect anything from politics**,  
but still feel, somewhere deep down,  
that **this country is worth more than its downfall**:  
this text is for you.

It asks nothing of you —  
except, perhaps, to reread the word *“us.”*

And to choose whether it is still worth embodying.
