# country#0 – Example of Civic Adaptation

This folder is a template for creating a national or regional fork of **Programme2027**.  
It demonstrates how to reuse the method, principles, and structure in a new local or national context.

---

## 📌 Purpose

- Localize the content to your country’s political, legal, and cultural reality
- Use TOGAFrance as a **method**, not a doctrine
- Build a citizen-based program in your language and context

---

## 📁 Suggested Folder Structure

- `/programme/` – Thematic chapters (translated or restructured)
- `/finance/` – National budget, funding models, macro or local estimations
- `/vision/` – Local context, guiding values, or civic preface
- `ROADMAP.md` – Timeline for national or regional milestones
- `README.md` – This file, in the local language
- Optionally: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

---

## ✍️ How to Start

- Fork this folder or replicate its structure
- Translate relevant parts from the France version if useful
- Replace all `country#0` mentions with your country name
- Add your own civic content in your language

> This is not a campaign model.  
> It's a civic skeleton — waiting for your voices.
