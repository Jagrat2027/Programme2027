# Contributing to country#0 (Adaptation Template)

This folder is a civic template. You are free to fork, translate, or customize it for your own country or territory.

## ✨ Ways to contribute

- Translate chapters from the France version into your language
- Replace examples with local policies, cultural references, and lived experience
- Write a civic preface (in `/vision/`) that explains your local context
- Document your roadmap and timeline in `roadmap.md`
- Open pull requests with changes, improvements, or experiments

---

## 📁 Recommended content

- `/programme/` → policy proposals or structural questions
- `/vision/` → principles, preamble, civic intent
- `ROADMAP.md` → your national or regional timeline
- `README.md` → introduction to your fork

## 🛠 Technical notes

- Keep file names in `kebab-case` or `snake_case`
- Credit the source (France version or others) where appropriate
- Document structural differences clearly if you diverge

> Your version doesn't need to be perfect. It needs to be **honest**, **relevant**, and **shareable**.
