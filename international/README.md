# /international – National & Regional Adaptations

This folder contains international forks and local adaptations of **Programme2027**.  
Each country, region, or territory can use the TOGAFrance method, principles, and structure to build its own civic framework — aligned with local realities and long-term needs.

## 🇫🇷 [Version française du projet ici → README-FR.md](./README-FR.md)

## 🌍 Purpose

Programme2027 is not just a French initiative — it is an open-source civic method.  
Every country has its own path, but we share:

- A human-centered philosophy
- A transparent, citizen-friendly structure
- A method for rebuilding public meaning

---

## 📁 Structure

Each country has its own folder:

- `/france/` – original version (2025–2027 roadmap)
- `/country#0/` – example of adaptation
- `/[your-country]/` – feel free to fork and contribute

Inside each country folder, you may include:

- `/programme/` – adapted political chapters
- `/vision/` – preface, values, national context
- `/budget`
- `roadmap.md` – local timeline
- `README.md` – description in your own language

---

## 🧭 Guidelines

- Respect the founding principles: clarity, reversibility, dignity, real-world impact.
- Credit the original source and document your changes transparently.
- Share back what works — every adaptation enriches the global method.

> ✨ TOGAFrance is not a brand. It is a method to help people reclaim coherence.
